									Warning! If you are arachnophobic you may not want to see this list,
									 but I really suggest that you do. You may find that these creatures are
									 more diverse and fascinating than they are creepy. Spiders have never ceased
									 to amaze me; they are among the most abundant predators in the world and have
									 adapted to almost any imaginable habitat except for the sea, giving rise to countless
									 species many of which remain unknown to science. If people would stop to watch spiders
									 instead of simply squashing them on sight,
									 I’m sure they would be amazed constantly. This list is only a very small selection of
									  bizarre spiders from around the world.

								<h2> What are the crustaceans? </h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<p>

									Everyone is pretty well acquainted with crustaceans: arthropods
									who dominate the seas as heavily as their insect sisters rule the land. But the familiar crabs, lobsters, and shrimp are
									only a few examples of this order’s vastness and incredibly varied diversity. Crustaceans can be found in virtually every
									 aquatic environment on earth, from
									 the freezing Arctic to hostile toxic springs, and include a dizzying array of predators,
									  scavengers, herbivores, and parasites.

				 What is also interesting about the giraffe weevil is its egg-laying technique. The female will roll up a leaf,

				 chambers open and the different chemicals mix. The gas is ejected from millions of pores around the body at
